# Security-Cam-Lens-Undistort-Image-Algorithms
Camera lens calibration and camera matrix retrieval.

I bought a cheap Tapo security cam, with a huge lens distortion. This scripts corrects it. Kinda.



## Warning!
This is some scripts I've made for tests and/or meaningless projects. They are not made to be easy to understand, optimized nor working. They surely have some interesting stuff so for any questions please talk to me in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-bonilla-salvador/).
